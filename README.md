## Screen dimmer

Small application that dims inactive screens. Sits in windows tray. For example if you are playing dark game and your second monitor is too bright and distracts you. App creates semi-transparent window with the size of each screen and puts them on top.

## TODO:

- [ ] NOT TESTED FOR 3+ SCREENS!!!
- [ ] Create release build configuration
- [ ] Probably Ditch QT stuff. It's too heavy for such a small app. However i want my apps to look nice.
- [ ] Research bettel deployment of Qt/QML
